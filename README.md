# ToastyReplayer
This is **ToastyReplayer.** Geometry Dash's best Macro Replay system. Made with _showcasers in mind,_ our replay system is 100% accurate, any level, anywhere.

## How does it work?
ToastyReplayer records players' clicks on a level and sends these clicks as a feedback request to our server. Once this is done, it will be usable for the entire mod's player base and can be played back with 100% accuracy. Our API detects if the latest completion was completed **With or without** coins, allowing for replayers to decide if they want coin-related routes on the playback.

## What about random or route-related levels?
Our replays save the **UserID's Seed**, which determines randomness throughout the level, allowing for the accuracy to stay the same. This ensures that all macros function correctly on all levels, regardless of their complexity or randomness.

## Safety and reliability.

We ensure that every user in our database should use this mod **solely** for showcase or experimental purposes. To ensure this is being demonstrated, we have implemented security features. _If you try and use ToastyReplayer for statistic gain on your or another user's account. Our mod makes sure it is traceable to a macro._ While we will not disclose the methods we use. It is 100% impossible to bypass. We hope this can help demonstrate a secure and safe environment for Geode and Geometry Dash. Extinguishing this from being considered a cheat.
