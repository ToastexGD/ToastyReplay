# ToastyReplay
This is **ToastyReplay.** Geometry Dash's best Macro Replay system. Made with _showcasers in mind,_ our replay system is 99%...

### **100% accurate. On any level, anywhere.**

## Functionality ðŸ“œ
ToastyReplay records players' clicks on a level and sends these clicks as a feedback request to our server. Once this is done, it will be usable for the entire mod's player base and can be played back with 100% accuracy. Our API detects if the latest completion was completed **With or without** coins, allowing for replayers to decide if they want coin-related routes on the playback.

## Random Seed Setup ðŸŽ²
How does our seed setup work? Let us demonstrate.
 
   `1. When a macro is uploaded to our servers, it automatically records the seed of the completion.`

  `2. It'll then replay the same seed when requested, allowing for a 100% accurate macro regardless of randomness.`

## Safety and reliability ðŸ”’

We ensure that every user in our database should use this mod **solely** for showcase or experimental purposes. To ensure this is being demonstrated, we have implemented security features.

__If you attempt to use ToastyReplay for statistical gain on your account or another user's account, our mod ensures that such actions are traceable to a macro.__ While we will not reveal the methods we employ, we want to emphasize that it is entirely impossible to bypass this system. We hope this reassures you of the secure and safe environment provided for Geode and Geometry Dash.
