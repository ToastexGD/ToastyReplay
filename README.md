# ToastyReplayer
This is **ToastyReplayer.** Geometry Dash's best Macro Replay system. Made with _showcasers in mind,_ our replay system is 99%...

### **100% accurate. On any level, anywhere.**

## Functionality ðŸ“œ
ToastyReplayer records players' clicks on a level and sends these clicks as a feedback request to our server. Once this is done, it will be usable for the entire mod's player base and can be played back with 100% accuracy. Our API detects if the latest completion was completed **With or without** coins, allowing for replayers to decide if they want coin-related routes on the playback.

## Random Seed Setup ðŸŽ²
How does our seed setup work? Let us demonstrate.
 
   `1. When a macro is uploaded to our servers, it automatically records the seed of the completion.`

  `2. It'll then replay the same seed when requested, allowing for a 100% accurate macro regardless of randomness.`

## Safety and reliability ðŸ”’

We ensure that every user in our database should use this mod **solely** for showcase or experimental purposes. To ensure this is being demonstrated, we have implemented security features.

_If you try and use ToastyReplayer for statistic gain on your or another user's account. Our mod makes sure it is traceable to a macro._ While we will not disclose the methods we use. 
It is 100% impossible to bypass. We hope this can help demonstrate a secure and safe environment for Geode and Geometry Dash.
