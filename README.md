# ToastyReplayer
This is **ToastyReplayer.** Geometry Dash's best Macro Replay system. Made with _showcasers in mind,_ our replay system is 100% accurate, any level, anywhere.

## How does it work?
ToastyReplayer records players' clicks on a level and sends these clicks as a feedback request to our server. Once this is done, it will be usable for the entirety of the mod's player base and can be played back with 100% accuracy. Our API detects if the latest completion was completed **With or without** coins, allowing for replayers to decide if they want coin-related routes on the playback.

## What about random or route-related levels?
Our replays save the **UserID's Seed**, which determines randomness throughout the level, allowing for the accuracy to stay the same. This makes sure all macros work on all levels, regardless of their randomness.
